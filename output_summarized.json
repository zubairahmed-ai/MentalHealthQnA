They range in severity from mild to serious, with some requiring hospital care. It is important to understand that mental illnesses are medical conditions and not a reflection of a person's character or intelligence. They are treatable with a combination of medication and social support, leading to a reduction in symptoms and improved quality of life.

It can affect anyone regardless of various factors such as gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Certain conditions may be more common in different populations, like eating disorders in females and ADHD in children. Mental illnesses can develop at any age, with 75 percent of cases starting by age 24. This makes it challenging to identify and treat these disorders, as the normal changes in personality and behavior during adolescence can mask symptoms. Parents and caretakers should pay attention to changes in mood, personality, habits, and social withdrawal in children under 18, which are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."
